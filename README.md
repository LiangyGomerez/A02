    <p>This is how GitHub works</p>
    <br>
    <p>GitHub is a platform that leverages Git, a version control system, to facilitate collaborative software development. Hereâ€™s a basic overview of how it works:</p>

    <p> ### 1. **Repositories (Repos)**:
           - A repository is a storage space for your project. It contains all the files and the history of changes made to those files.
           - You can create a public repo (open to everyone) or a private one (restricted access).</p>
        
       <p> ### 2. **Version Control**:
           - Git tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate effectively.</p>
        
      <p>  ### 3. **Branches**:
           - Branches allow multiple versions of a project to be developed simultaneously. For example, you might have a "main" branch for stable code and a "development" branch for ongoing changes.
           - You can create new branches to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.</p>
        
        <p>### 4. **Commits**:
           - A commit is a snapshot of your changes. Each commit has a unique identifier and includes a message describing what changes were made.
           - Commits can be pushed to GitHub to update the repository.</p>
        
       <p> ### 5. **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
           - When you want to merge changes from one branch into another (like from a feature branch to the main branch), you create a pull request.
           - Other collaborators can review your changes, comment, and suggest modifications before merging.</p>
        
       <p> ### 6. **Issues**:
           - GitHub includes a built-in issue tracker for reporting bugs, requesting features, or discussing improvements.
           - Issues can be assigned to team members, labeled, and prioritized.</p>
        
        <p>### 7. **Collaboration**:
           - Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously. GitHub manages merging changes and resolving conflicts when different contributors edit the same parts of the code.</p>
        
       <p> ### 8. **GitHub Actions**:
           - This feature allows you to automate workflows, such as testing code, deploying applications, or running scripts based on events (like when a commit is pushed).
        </p>

       <p> ### 9. **Forking**:
           - You can create a personal copy of someone else's repository (fork) to make changes or experiment without affecting the original project.
           - Once you make changes, you can submit a pull request to propose merging your changes back into the original repository.</p>
        
       <p> 10. **Community and Documentation**:
           - GitHub hosts extensive documentation, community forums, and a marketplace for tools that can enhance your workflow.</p>
        
       <p> By using GitHub, developers can collaborate more effectively, keep track of their work, and maintain a clear history of project development.</p>
